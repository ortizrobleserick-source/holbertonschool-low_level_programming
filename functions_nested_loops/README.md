# Functions & Nested Loops

## Description
This directory contains exercises from the Holberton School curriculum about **functions and nested loops in C**.  
The exercises focus on:
- Using `_putchar` to print characters.
- Understanding nested loops (for, while).
- Writing and using functions properly.
- Creating and including header files with function prototypes.

## Files
- `_putchar.c` : Contains the implementation of the `_putchar` function.
- `0-putchar.c` : Prints `_putchar` followed by a new line using `_putchar`.
- `main.h` : Header file containing prototypes for functions used in this directory.

## Compilation
To compile your files:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 _putchar.c 0-putchar.c -o 0-putchar
